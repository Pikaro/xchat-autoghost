xchat-autoghost
======

Another autghosting script, intended to circumvent some problems that others I found were unable to handle. (Restricted channels, for instance.)

Attention: Currently, this script is only tested on FreeNode and Mozilla servers. Unfortunately, NickServ and server messages are different from server to server, so there is no reliable way to make it work everywhere. If you notice that a particular function is not working, please message me with the relevant line.

USAGE
======
Copy autoghost.py into your xchat configuration directory. (System-dependent; on Linux, it's ~/.xchat2.) Rest _should_ work automatically, provided that you set your desired nick and password correctly for the server in question.

HISTORY
======

This doesn't really need one.

TODO
======

- _Maybe_ find a better way to make this interoperable. Unlikely, though.

BUGS
======

none known
